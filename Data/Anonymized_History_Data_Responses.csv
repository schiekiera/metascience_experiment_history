By reconstructing a key symbol of Prussian heritage, the Forum celebrates an era of profound intellectual, cultural, and scientific achievements. The analysis highlights the Forum’s curatorial and architectural choices as a necessary reclamation of Germany’s Prussian past, which it argues is crucial for a balanced understanding of national identity.","text/2b.html_decision1",25,2572,4,5,2268,32,2034,0,866,24817,NA,15.628
