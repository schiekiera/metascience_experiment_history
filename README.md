# Metascience experiment history
This repository contains anonymized data for a metascientific experiment on the influence of political preferences on historians' assessments of progressive and conservative research abstracts.

# Abstract
## Background:
This study examines the influence of political preferences on historians' assessments of the publishability of contemporary history abstracts by investigating whether historians favor abstracts that align with their political orientation.
## Methods:
In an online experiment, 75 historians evaluated 17 fictitious contemporary history abstracts from 17 pairs, each presented with either a progressive or conservative stance. The participants made initial intuitive assessments regarding the publishability of each abstract and later provided more considered responses, also rating their Feeling of Rightness (FOR) regarding their initial judgments. 
## Results:
The results revealed a significant interaction effect between an abstract’s political stance and historians’ political orientation, consistent with the observation that right-wing historians prefer conservative abstracts, left-wing historians prefer progressive abstracts, and moderate historians show no preference for either. Overall, participants preferred progressive abstracts, largely reflecting a majority of left-leaning historians in our sample. Moreover, after reconsidering their responses and providing FOR ratings, participants’ initial decisions did not significantly change. 
## Conclusions:
Our study suggests that political preferences influence research evaluations and are not diminished by more deliberate processing, as demonstrated through the case study of historians.
