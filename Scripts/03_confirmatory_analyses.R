## 3. CONFIRMATORY ANALYSES (MLM)  ##
#####################################

# All hypotheses were analyzed using multilevel models (MLM) to account for the nested structure
# of the data within both participants and abstracts. The likelihood of submitting an abstract
# for publication (LoS) is hypothesized to be influenced by characteristics of both participants
# and abstracts.

# Note: The structure of our experimental data is cross-classified, not strictly hierarchical,
# because the same 17 abstracts are presented to all participants, and the abstracts differ
# only according to the political stance manipulation. This results in a counterbalanced design
# with a cross-classified data structure.

# We use cross-classified multilevel modeling to address this (Hox, 2002).


# Model Formula:
# response ~ political stance (abstract) + political orientation (individual) +
#            political stance (abstract) * political orientation (individual) +
#            (political stance (abstract) | participant) + (1 | abstract)

# Explanation of the model:
# The model decomposes the variation in of the response (LoS) for participant j rating abstract i into random and fixed effects.

# Fixed Effects:
# - political stance (abstract): Effect of the abstract's political stance on LoS
# - political orientation (individual): Effect of the participant's political orientation on LoS
# - political stance (abstract) * political orientation (individual): Interaction effect between the abstract's political stance and the participant's political orientation

# Random Effects:
# - (political stance (abstract) | participant):
#   (a) Random slope for participants based on the political stance of an abstract
#   (b) Random intercept at the participant level
# - (1 | abstract): Random intercept at the abstract level

# Coding for political stance:
# - Progressive abstracts are coded as political stance (abstract) = -1
# - Conservative abstracts are coded as political stance (abstract) = 1

# - political_scale: fixed effect representing participants' political orientation (1: very progressive to 7: very conservative)
# - treatment * political_scale: interaction effect between treatment and political orientation to examine if the effect of treatment
#   on decision1_resp changes with different political orientations
# - (treatment | id): random slope for treatment within participants (id) to account for individual variability in responses to treatment
# - (1 | abstract): random intercept for abstracts to account for variability between different abstracts
